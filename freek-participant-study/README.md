# Freek Participant Study

Dutch Streamlit application for a participant study about humour and style.

The project is being delivered in the checkpoints described in
[`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md). Checkpoint 5 adds one
complete joke-group workflow with eight randomized versions, two required
Likert sliders per version, and an optional group comment.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer
- `pip`

## Local Setup

Run all commands from this directory:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run The App

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Streamlit prints the local URL, normally <http://localhost:8501>.

The temporary checkpoint-2 stimulus preview is available at:

<http://localhost:8501/?preview=1>

Change the port in this URL if Streamlit selected another local port.

## Checkpoint 3 Test Links

These links are test-only and may safely be committed to the repository:

1. `?session=test-01-DU8NXu1m`
2. `?session=test-02-CVM5_s67`
3. `?session=test-03-viwspebC`
4. `?session=test-04-es8fvhYW`
5. `?session=test-05-SIhk_boI`
6. `?session=test-06-fDpGFu6p`
7. `?session=test-07-SNKbCw41`
8. `?session=test-08-bxdyKo5y`
9. `?session=test-09-rHQtzmEl`
10. `?session=test-10-KvPvblxx`

Append one of these paths to the local app URL. For example:

<http://localhost:8501/?session=test-01-DU8NXu1m>

## Automated Checks

Run the dependency-free health and stimulus-contract tests:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

With the application running, verify Streamlit's process health endpoint:

```bash
curl --fail http://localhost:8501/_stcore/health
```

The expected response is `ok`.

## Checkpoint 5 Acceptance Test

1. Complete the checkpoint-4 participant questions.
2. Choose `Verder` on the profile confirmation screen.
3. Confirm one descriptive group contains `Versie A` through `Versie H`.
4. Confirm every version has both required sliders and starts at `Kies`.
5. Submit everything untouched and inspect the 16 validation messages.
6. Give every slider a value from 1 through 5 and optionally add a comment.
7. Confirm the group-completion screen appears.
8. Choose `Terug naar groep` and verify the selected ratings remain.
9. Resize to a narrow mobile width and inspect the stacked sliders.
10. Run the automated and HTTP health checks above.

Checkpoint 5 keeps the validated profile and group response only in Streamlit
session memory. Durable autosave is introduced in checkpoint 7.

The stimulus contract is documented in [`STUDY_SPEC.md`](STUDY_SPEC.md).

## Configuration

Shared Streamlit settings live in `.streamlit/config.toml`.

Local secrets will later live in `.streamlit/secrets.toml`. That file is ignored
by Git and must never be committed.

# Freek Participant Study

Dutch Streamlit application for a participant study about humour and style.

The project is being delivered in the checkpoints described in
[`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md). Checkpoint 2 adds the
versioned study specification, validated fictional mock stimuli, and an internal
stimulus preview. Participant sessions and the rating flow are not active yet.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer
- `pip`

## Local Setup

Run all commands from this directory:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run The App

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Streamlit prints the local URL, normally <http://localhost:8501>.

The temporary checkpoint-2 stimulus preview is available at:

<http://localhost:8501/?preview=1>

Change the port in this URL if Streamlit selected another local port.

## Automated Checks

Run the dependency-free health and stimulus-contract tests:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

With the application running, verify Streamlit's process health endpoint:

```bash
curl --fail http://localhost:8501/_stcore/health
```

The expected response is `ok`.

## Checkpoint 2 Acceptance Test

1. Open `/?preview=1`.
2. Select each of the 12 joke groups.
3. Confirm every selected group shows 8 variants.
4. Review the Dutch wording, group titles, internal roles, and tone.
5. Resize the browser to a narrow mobile width and check readability.
6. Run the automated and HTTP health checks above.

The stimulus contract is documented in [`STUDY_SPEC.md`](STUDY_SPEC.md).

## Configuration

Shared Streamlit settings live in `.streamlit/config.toml`.

Local secrets will later live in `.streamlit/secrets.toml`. That file is ignored
by Git and must never be committed.
